# EventMaker

The main idea of this project was to make a system for creating events and registering users in them. That would help people find their like-minded people and create activities with them.

#Getting Started

When you go to the web application site, the user sees the main page and the opportunity to register or log in.Registration is based on the principle: fill in the data and confirm the registration. After that, access to the web application as a user will appear. Then there will be an opportunity to create, participate and comment on events.
